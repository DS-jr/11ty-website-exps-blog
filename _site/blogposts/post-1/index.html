        <p>- **About long-term thinking, unrealistic beliefs & difficulties of achieving new goals (skills, habits, KPIs etc)** <br>
            A story from Jeff Bezos' annual shareholder letter (2018) about handstand coach who explained it would take six months to master the skill:<br> 
        </p>
        <pre>    
            "A close friend recently decided to learn to do a perfect free-standing handstand. No leaning against a wall. Not for just a few seconds. 
            
            She decided to start her journey by taking a handstand workshop at her yoga studio. She then practiced for a while but wasn't getting the results she wanted. 
                
            So, she hired a handstand coach. Yes, I know what you're thinking, but evidently this is an actual thing that exists. 
        </pre>
        <p>
            In the very first lesson, the coach gave her some wonderful advice. 
            "Most people," he said, "think that if they work hard, they should be able to master a handstand in about two weeks. 
            The reality is that it takes about six months of daily practice. 
            If you think you should be able to do it in two weeks, you're just going to end up quitting." 
            Unrealistic beliefs on scope – often hidden and undiscussed – kill high standards. 
            To achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be – something this coach understood well.” 
            ***The annual letter, which Bezos has published every year since 1997, is widely considered a must-read by business professionals for its rich detail around the Amazon CEO's management principle and long-term thinking.

        <p> "Productivity inside a team" by Tesla:  
            - Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get of all large meetings, unless you’re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short.
            - Also get rid of frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.
            - Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.
            - Don’t use acronyms or nonsense words for objects, software or processes at Tesla. In general, anything that requires an explanation inhibits communication. We don’t want people to have to memorize a glossary just to function at Tesla.
            - Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the “chain of command”. Any manager who attempts to enforce chain of command communication will soon find themselves working elsewhere.
            - A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is allow free flow of information between all levels. It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right thing happen.
            - In general, always pick common sense as your guide. If following a “company rule” is obviously ridiculous in a particular situation  =>  the rule should change.
