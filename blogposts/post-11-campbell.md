Some ideas I've collected from Joseph Campbell (world-level expert in mythology, professor of literature, writer):

- “The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.”
- “We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.”
- "A hero is smb who did smth BEYOND the normal range of achievement; and who has GIVEN his LIFE to SMTH BIGGER than himself (or other than himself).
A hero is NOT a perfect person who always gets things right. Far from it.
Heroes do NOT BEGIN as heroes; they BECOME them because of the way one thing leads to another."
- “The real dragon is in you. Ex.: your ego & fears holding you in.”
- “It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure.”
- “If the path before you is clear, you're probably on someone else's.”
- “If the person doesn’t listen to the demands of his own spiritual and heart life, and insists on a certain program, he is going to have a difficult life.
This person has put himself off-center. He has aligned himself with a programmatic life and it’s not the one the body is interested in at all.”
- “Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.”
- "Follow your BLISS and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls".
- “People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.”
- “Life is like arriving late for a movie, having to figure out what was going on without bothering everybody with a lot of questions, and then being unexpectedly called away before you find out how it ends.”
- If you want to find out more about yourself, go on ADVENTURES and put yourself in NEW situations where life evokes your character.
Better to put yourself in situations that will evolve your higher nature rather than your lower”
- "To become a hero, the character must often die (physically or mentally) and then is resurrected as a new person. Ex.: a child must let their infant personality and psyche die in order to become an adult."
- “The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the Universe, to match your nature with Nature.”
- “As you proceed through life, following your own path, birds will shit on you. Don't bother to brush it off. Getting a comedic view of your situation gives you spiritual distance. Having a sense of humor saves you.”
- “We're NOT on our journey to save the world, but to save ourselves. But in doing that you save the world. The influence of a vital person vitalizes.”
- “Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.”
- “The job of an educator is to teach students to see vitality in themselves”.

If interested to listen to a 1-hour interview w/ Joseph Campbell by Bill Moyers (recorded in 1988) — check the audio [here](https://tim.blog/2020/08/27/the-power-of-myth-joseph-campbell/) (this recording from 1988 is played for FREE in episode #456 of "Tim Ferriss podcast", who has arranged the copyright issues w/ the owners).
They discuss myths as metaphors for human experience and the path to transcendence.
Campbell encourages listeners to discover what excites them, and to make that the basis for their personal journeys.
